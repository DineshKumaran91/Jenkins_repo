Architecture:
Developer1
           -->JavaCode --> Commit code to SourceCodeRepo-->  JenkinsCI --> Maven --> Selenium(Test server) --> Production
Developer2


After Code commit:
 - Jenkins server checks the repo regular interval and pulls if any new code available.
 - Build server builds the code into executable file --> above example java file will be converted into JAR file using Maven(build server).(Maven plugin runs in Jenking environment).
 - In case the build fails, a feedback is sent to developers.
 - Finally Jenkins then deploy the build app on test server --> Here we using selenium and if test fails then the feedback will be sent to developers(Selenium plugin runs in Jenking environment).
 - If no error then tested app will be deloyed to test environment.


Master_Slave Architecture:
                                          --> Jenkins slave
 SourceCodeRepo --> Master Jenkins server --> Jenkins slave
                                          --> Jenkins slave

 - Master Jenkins pulls the newly commit code from repo
 - Master distributs the workload to slave hosts
 - Slaves perform the build,test and produce test reports
